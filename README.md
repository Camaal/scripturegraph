## Expanding Bible Study with Graph Theory

#### Connection-based exploration
You can look up a specific book or chapter or just browse using the number of connections they have to other verses. Each book is listed in the order it was written, but lists the total number of connections contains across all the verses. The number of connections is also listed in the scripture view as well.

#### Explore different perspectives
It is nice to start with a specific verse and then explore how other authors may have written verses related verses but from different testaments or points in time. Each author is ordered and sized by the number of connections their verses have to others.

#### Keep original text in view
Instead of losing your place while explore the cross-references, the connected authors, genres, and scripture verses are always listed on the side. That way you can continue reading your original text while gleaning insight from the constellations of references.
